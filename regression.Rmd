The following data (*bloodpress.txt*) on 20 individuals with high blood pressure
\begin{enumerate}
\item blood pressure (y = BP, in mm Hg)
\item age (x1 = Age, in years)
\item weight (x2 = Weight, in kg)
\item body surface area (x3 = BSA, in sq m)
\item duration of hypertension (x4 = Dur, in years)
\item basal pulse (x5 = Pulse, in beats per minute)
\item stress index (x6 = Stress)
\end{enumerate}

The researchers were interested in determining if a relationship exists between blood pressure and age, weight, body surface area, duration, pulse rate and/or stress level.

```{r}
bloodpress <- read.table()

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
