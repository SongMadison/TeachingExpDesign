##This script is to instruct people to analyze data from split-plot design and hierachical design

First create a data set about wheat and herbicide, learning the effects of wheat variety(A0,A1),and rates of a herbicide(B0,B1,B2,B3)

design as follows: 3 blocks(replicates), in each block there are two plots (whole-plot) to grow a varietey of wheat; Besides, the whole-plot is divided into four sub-plots to apply different rates of a herbicide.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())  # clean up memory
Dat <- data.frame(list(
  observation = 1:24,
  replicate = rep(c("I","II","III"),each =8),
  A = rep(rep(c("A0","A1"),each = 4),3),
  B = rep(c("B0","B1","B2","B3"),times = 6 ),
  yield = c(13.8,15.5,21.0,18.9,19.3,22.2,25.3,25.9,
            13.5,15.0,22.7,18.3,18.0,24.2,24.8,26.7,
            13.2,15.2,22.3,19.6,20.5,25.4,28.4,27.6)
  ))
```


Without knowledge of the design, the analysis below is not accurate.
```{r}
aov.bad <- aov(yield~replicate+ A*B, data =Dat)
summary(aov.bad)
```
```{r}
#Library
library(agricolae)
## if we think replicates, no blocking effect
aov.good<- aov(yield~ A*B+Error(replicate:A), data =Dat)
summary(aov.good)

## if we think we need consider block effect. put replicate in the model
aov.good2<- aov(yield~ replicate + A*B + Error(replicate:A), data =Dat)
summary(aov.good2)
```

Do some diagnosis to check the assumptions, mainly on the residuals


```{r}
#diagnosis 
aov.good3<- aov(yield~ replicate + A+replicate:A +  B  + A:B, data =Dat)
summary(aov.good3)
plot(aov.good3, 1)
plot(aov.good3, 2)
plot(aov.good3, 5)
library(car)
boxCox(aov.good3)
```


## Part 2: R code to analyze hierarchical design. The table is from table 9.8 on page 350.

The hierarchical model is :
   $Y_{ijk} = \mu +\alpha_i + \beta_{(i)j}+\epsilon_{ijk}$
   
   where:
$\mu$: constant; overall mean

$\alpha_i$: constant for ith treatment group; deviation from mean of i

$\beta_ij$: a random effect due to the ith group nested witin the jth experimental unit

$\epsilon_{ijk}$: andom deviation associated with each observation

```{r}
pigment <- data.frame(list(
  batch = rep(1:15,each=4),
  sample = rep(1:30,each =2),
  test = 1:60,
  y = c( 40,39,30,30,26,28,25,26,29,28,14,15,30,31,24,24, 
         19,20,17,17,33,32,26,24,23,24,32,33,34,34,29,29,
         27,27,31,31,13,16,27,24,25,23,25,27,29,29,31,32,
         19,20,29,30,23,23,25,25,39,37,26,28)
  ))
pigment$batch <- as.factor(pigment$batch)
pigment$sample <- as.factor(pigment$sample)
pigment$test <- as.factor(pigment$test)
aov.pigment <- aov(y~batch+sample+test,data=pigment)
summary(aov.pigment)

#another method:
anova(lm(y~batch/sample,data=pigment))  #test part is just random noise

```
